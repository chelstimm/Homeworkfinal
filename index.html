            <p> If you really want to get to know me, you should know that I'm always looking for a reason to celebrate. I love to celebrate birthdays, holidays, a job well done, you name it. That's probably why I'm so glad to have seasons. A fresh new season always entails some sort of celebrating in the months ahead.</p>
        
            <p> While most people have a favorite season, my favorite is the beginning of each one. Welcoming each new season with traditions I've created over the years is something I really look forward to.  It might be building the first snowman of the winter season and finishing it off with the first cup of hot chocolate or dipping our toes into the pool for the first time, welcoming in the hot summer days ahead. Each season has it’s own holidays, activities, smells and flavors that are unique to that specific time of year and nothing beats the ‘firsts’ you experience as each new season begins. ’Tis the Season’ rings true the whole year through and definitely gives me plenty of reasons to celebrate!</p>
